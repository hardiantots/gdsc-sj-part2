About The Project for GDSC Study Jam 

This is data science project that focused on understanding customer cancellations in the hotel industry with two classification class is :
- 0 (not_canceled)
- 1 (canceled)

Using 3 machine learning method (Supervised Learning) :
1. Logistic Regression
2. k-NN
3. Decision Tree

Evaluation Metric using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-1 Score.

There are several things that can still be added to this project, namely as follows:
- Exploratory Data Analysis is still not widely done, so more in-depth analysis can be done by looking at the distribution of each column, looking for insights related to existing data to get information conclusions that can be useful later, etc.
- Feature engineering can be applied to add new features needed to help make predictions more accurate
- Can proceed to the deployment stage
- etc.
